# Mastering Java Programming

This repository is a comprehensive guide to mastering the core of Java programming. It systematically covers everything from basic syntax to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), essential libraries, and file handling.

### **Core Concepts and Syntax**

* Java is built on the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, which is made possible by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* Every program consists of a class containing a `main()` method, and manages data using variables, the eight primitive data types, and constants.
* You can control the execution flow of a program with statements like `if-else`, `switch`, and loops such as `for` and `while`.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

* Java models the real world using **Objects**, which are created from blueprints called **Classes**.
* **Encapsulation** bundles data (fields) and functionality (methods) within a class, protecting data from outside access.
* **Inheritance** allows for reusing and extending code from existing classes, while **Polymorphism** enables a method with the same name to behave differently depending on the object.
* **Abstract classes** and **interfaces** are used to design class structures and enforce implementation contracts.

### **Data Structures and Utilities**

* **Arrays** are used to store a fixed-size collection of data of the same type.
* The **Collections Framework** offers dynamic data structures like `ArrayList` and `HashMap`, with **Generics** ensuring type safety.
* The `String` class handles immutable sequences of characters, and the `Math` class provides essential mathematical functions.
* You can effectively handle runtime errors using **exception** handling with `try-catch` blocks.

### **File Input/Output (I/O)**

* A **Stream** is a channel that handles the flow of data between a program and an external source, like a file or network.
* Text files are handled with **character streams** (`Reader`, `Writer`), while binary files use **byte streams** (`InputStream`, `OutputStream`).
* The `File` class can be used to manage files and directories in the file system.
