# Chapter 1. Computers, Software, and the Evolution of Java

---

### Computers and Software

- Computers come in various forms: mainframes, PCs, tablets, smartphones, and embedded systems.
- Software (or apps) runs on these devices, enabling a wide range of functionalities.

---

### Programming Languages

- **Machine Language:**  
  The lowest-level language, composed of binary (0s and 1s), directly understood by the CPU.
- **Assembly Language:**  
  Uses mnemonic symbols (e.g., ADD, SUB, MOVE) as a more readable representation of machine instructions.
- **High-Level Languages:**  
  Designed for human readability and to express complex logic and data structures. Examples include Pascal, Basic, C/C++, Java, and C#. These can be procedural or object-oriented.

---

### Evolution of Programming Languages

- Programming languages have evolved from machine and assembly languages to high-level, human-friendly languages, supporting more complex applications and data structures.

---

### Compilation

- Source files written in programming languages are compiled into machine code that computers can execute.
- Each language has its own compilation process and file extensions (e.g., Java: `.java` → `.class`, C: `.c` → `.obj` → `.exe`).

---

### WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)

- Java programs are compiled into platform-neutral bytecode, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- This allows Java applications to execute on any platform with a compatible JVM, overcoming platform dependency.
- The JVM interprets bytecode at runtime, providing a consistent execution environment across different operating systems and hardware.

---

### Java Development and Execution Environment

- Java source code is compiled into bytecode (`.class` files), which are loaded and executed by the JVM as needed.
- Unlike C/C++, Java does not require linking all code into a single executable; classes are loaded dynamically.
- Java applications start from the `main()` method in a class.

---

### Java Editions and Distribution

- **Java SE (Standard Edition):** For desktop and server applications.
- **Java ME (Micro Edition):** For resource-constrained devices like mobile phones and embedded systems.
- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition):** For large-scale, multi-user, enterprise applications.

---

### Java API and Packages

- The Java API is a comprehensive library of pre-built classes included in the JDK.
- Classes are organized into packages, which group related functionality and help avoid naming conflicts.
- Developers can also create their own packages.

---

### Modularity in Java (Java 9+)

- Java 9 introduced modular programming, allowing applications and the platform itself to be divided into modules for better organization, smaller runtime environments, and support for IoT devices.

---

### Java Development Tools

- The JDK includes tools like `javac` (compiler), `java` (runtime), `javadoc` (documentation generator), `jar` (archive manager), and `javap` (disassembler).
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse provide comprehensive tools for editing, compiling, debugging, and managing Java projects.

---

### Java Application Types

- **Desktop Applications:** Run independently on PCs with a JRE installed.
- **Servlet Applications:** Java programs running on web servers, often interacting with databases and other servers.
- **Mobile Applications:** Android apps are developed in Java, though they use a different runtime (Dalvik/ART).

---

### Key Features of Java

- **Platform Independence:** Runs on any system with a JVM.
- **Object-Oriented:** Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Automatic Memory Management:** Garbage collection relieves developers from manual memory management.
- **Safety and Security:** Strict type checking, no pointers.
- **Multithreading:** Native support for concurrent programming.
- **Rich Libraries:** Extensive standard APIs for various functionalities.
- **Performance:** Uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation to improve execution speed.

### Global Usage and Popularity

- Java has consistently ranked as one of the most popular programming languages worldwide, widely used in desktop, server, and mobile development.
